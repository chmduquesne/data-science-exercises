What is this
------------
A bunch of Notebooks I wrote to better master some popular Data Science
frameworks.

How to reproduce
----------------

You need virtualenv and python3. Then just type

    make

This will launch jupyter lab in a browser, on the directory of the
notebooks.

Just looking
------------

Good! Then head on to
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chmduquesne/data-science-exercises/tree/master/notebooks/)
to see the notebooks in interactive mode, or just see them on
[github](https://github.com/chmduquesne/data-science-exercises/tree/master/notebooks).
